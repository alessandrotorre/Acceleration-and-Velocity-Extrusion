# Acceleration-and-Velocity-Extrusion

This is a step by step guide  to test the version of Acceleration and Velocity of extrusion. 
Here, there is everything you need to test it.

- A glade widget that can be added to yours GUI - gmoccapy or axis. 
- the hal file with nettings "from and to" the component and the GUI.
- the M codes 
- the postprocessor for cura

1. setup a config with gmoccapy or axis as GUI
2. create your MCODE path ( Ex. mkdir /home/machinekit/machinekit/MCODE)
3. add that path in the [RS274NGC] section of your ini file ( Ex. USER_M_PATH = home/machinekit/machinekit/MCODE ) 
4. put all the Mcodes in your MCODE path 
5. give permissions to the path ( sudo chmod +x -R /home/machinekit/machinekit/MCODE )
6. install machinekit-dev 
   sudo apt-get install machinekit-dev
7. Install the components. In the pattern where you extracted the .comp, write:
sudo halcompile --install VelocityExtrusion.comp
sudo halcompile --install orLastVariation.comp

8. in the [DISPLAY] section of your ini file
add

>EMBED_TAB_NAME=Acceleration and Velocity of Extrusion

>EMBED_TAB_LOCATION = ntb_preview

>EMBED_TAB_COMMAND= gladevcp -x {XID} -H AccVelExtr.hal ./guiAccVelExtr.ui

9. put the guiVelExtr.ui and AccVelExtr.hal files in the same folder of your .ini file and give the execution permission to both 
10. add the postprocessor for CURA in the cura plugin folder.

11. In the machine settings of CURA, chose Gcode flavor Mach3/linuxCNC 

Hints
In VE_cura_postprocessor.py I used an infill volume of 1.9 instead of 1, because the slicer makes the lines pattern in a crossed way of 90Â° between layers and it generates infill without floor. If you want you can change that parameter at line 56 of VE_cura_linuxcnc.py

Mcodes leggends 
It is easier for me remember the command that ends with "1" like 111, 131 or 151 as "ON" status and the ones that ends with "0" like 110,130 or 150 as "off" status.


- M110 switch to normal mode, not Velocity Extrusion
- M111 switch to Velocity Extrusion mode
- M120 Pxx.xx: sets the layer height
- M130 do a retraction of xx mm at at velocity specificated in the GUI
- M131 do a precharge of xx mm at Velocity specificated in the GUI
- M135 Pxx.xx: sets the Nozzle diameter
- M150 unlink the nozzle
- M151 link the nozzle

Todo
- improve the preventive homing of the A axis and g92 A0
- fix the bugs of the postprocessor
